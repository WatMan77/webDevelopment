# webDevelopment
A project I made during the Web Software Development course at Aalto University. 
It uses Deno and Javascript. To make it work on your computer, in the .env file, insert the host, user and password of your database.
In the cmd type: deno run --allow-all --unstable app.js.
This project was done with Postgre SQL
The site keeps track of users moods and overall feeling of the day during morning and evening.
